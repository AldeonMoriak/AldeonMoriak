# Hello, I'm Aldeon aka Mehran 👋

## About Me

I'm an experienced Frontend Developer by day and a hobbyist Game Developer by night (or at least I'm trying to be one 😊 )

## Interests

- 🎸 Playing guitar
- ✏️ Drawing
- 📚 Reading books (mostly fantasy)

## Github Projects

Usually I play around with some ideas and sometimes finish them.

Some of the finished games are:
- A platformer game built using Godot 4 (can be found on [itch.io](https://aldeonmoriak.itch.io))
- A Sudoku game built using Svelte
- A Tetris game built using Godot 4 (a buggy one can be found using Vue, so it's more like a prototype for my MASTERPIECE)

You can find a bunch of different apps in here which are mostly half baked but still taught me a lot about software developement. Some of the technologies I used in them are:
- TypeScript (of course)
- Vue (Nuxt)
- NestJS (The only backend framework I fell in love with)
- Tailwind (WindiCSS)
- Deno
